# Early-Alzheimer-disease-detection
Objective: Develop and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model for detecting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using brain MRI images, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and early detection.

Motivation: To provide a reliable, cost-effective, and faster alternative to traditional diagnostic methods, which are often costly, time-consuming, and prone to human error.

Key Focus: Identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and differentiating between various stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
